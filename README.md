#30DaysofLearning CAPSTONE PROJECT

### PROJECT OBJECTIVE
There is no essence to learning if it will not be put into practice, so this is what prompted this project. This task was given to us as our Capstone project at #30daysoflearning class, which was organised by some Microsoft employees to assist the Nigeria students, who have been at home since February due to the industrial strike of their institutions staff (ASUU, SSANU and NASU).
We were given two dataset of Airlines to work on either of them (Delayed flights and Crash flights) and bring out the underlying facts of those data.
I accessed the two datasets, explained below is the description and analysis of the Airline Delay Datasets.
The metrics derived from the analysis include: 
1.	The number of Airports
2.	The number of Airlines
3.	The days people travelled most
4.	The days there is more delay in flight take-off
5.	Tendency of one’s flight being delayed per day
6.	The airline that has more delay record
7.	The most used airline.


### DATA SOURCE
This data was gotten from a GitHub data storage of this class #30DaysofLearning, as our capstone project, but the origin of the dataset can be trace to Kaggle.
### DATA CLEANING
This data was cleaned in Power Query, and some transformations were also made to the data.

### ANALYSIS / OBSERVATION
This analysis was carried out across 18 Airlines

It was observed that the total number of airports used for this analysis were 293

When analysing this dataset, it shows that there were more passengers on Wednesdays, and hereby lead to having more flight taking off on Wednesdays than every other days

But, despite Wednesdays being the days with a greater number of flights take-off, it was notice that there were more delays on Tuesdays than the most busy day which is Wednesday, and this prompted us to finding the days with the highest tendency of being delay and it shows that Tuesday has the highest tendency of being delay.

And the airline with most passengers is WN airlines with about 94,097 passengers, which is about 17.43% of the total passengers

### VISUALISATION
This data has 3 visuals and one homepage making it 4 pages in total, there is  2 Reports for Flight details and Analysis of the delay, and a Dashboard summarizing everything. Some Icons were also used for page navigation

### RECOMMENDATIONS
  •	Based on the analysis, it shows that despite WN airline being the airlines with the highest record of delay, people still patronize them more and for this reason, WN airline will be highly recommend because people used them most, and also trust them this might be due to their high level of customer relations or the way to handle their customers baggage or in-flight conveniency, but WN airline will be highly advised to work more on their time accuracy so as not to use that to later affect their airline.
  
•	Despite the fact that most people use  WN airline, it will be highly recommended to use another airline in the case of an emergency journey. 

•	And the record shows that, there is more chance of one’s flight taking-off at the exact time on Fridays, than any other day, which means one’s journey time can be predicted and have accurate result on this day, than any other days.
